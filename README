Tracker - http://burtonsamograd.github.io/tracker
-------------------------------------------------

Tracker is the start of a Music Tracker[1] interface written using
PX2[2] and Parenscript[3].

Currently supports basic multiple pattern and song variable editing,
along with the basic idea of loading samples and instruments.  Double
click fields to edit them; double click a sample name to load it as an
instrument.

THIS DOES NOT PRODUCE SOUND, it was done as a UI proof of concept and
bug fixing journey for PX2 and Parenscript, but then I ran into some
sort of bug in the PS compiler and it took the wind out of my sails.
